## Realms

DAOs using [Realms](https://realms.today/realms) can easily access our risk-managed Vault. Simply create a new proposal and:

1. Select either the `"Castle: Deposit into Vault"` or `"Castle: Withdraw from Vault"`
2. Select a `Source account`: the SPL token account from which to send tokens. This will be either the Deposit Asset (e.g. USDC) or the LP token
3. Select a `Castle Vault Destination:` The actual Vault you will be depositing into or withdrawing from.
4. Enter an `Amount`: the amount of SPL token to deposit or withdraw.
