# Security Policy

## Bug Bounty

Castle Labs is now offering a Bug Bounty program for security researchers that discover vulnerabilities or exploits in Castle's Solana programs.

Security vulnerabilities or other high-severity vulnerabilities that are successfully reported following the terms of the Bug Bounty program can be eligible for a reward of up to **$100,000**, depending on severity.

### Rewards
